# OSIRiS (Officeworks Store Initialization Routine and Scritps)
OSIRiS V1 is a tool kit for working on display/demo computers at Officeworks
or other environments where Group Policies and system images are
impractical. 
It makes setting up and selling display computers less of a chore and a more
streamlined process by automating most of the commonly performed tasks.
It also has the benefit of creating a standardised setup for all display computers.

#The key goals of OSIRiS deployment are:

To create a great place for people to shop and try computers.
Allow the use of display computers in a safe environment with
reduced risk of unwanted materials being on the machines.
To prevent configuration changes to the display computers.
The ability to deploy a display computer and have it operate
in an optimum configuration reliably in a significant amount
less time than was previously possible.
To allow a team member to sell a display computer and have
it in a clean and usable state for the customer in a minimum amount
of time.
To allow team members to format external hard disk drives and 
USB flash drives for customers in a fast and efficient manner in
a variety of file systems.

OSIRiS is written in C# and is open source under the GPL.
