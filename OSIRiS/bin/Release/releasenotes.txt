2.8.1.9:
ROSY landing page is operational at https://gnuplusadam.com/OSIRiS/ROSY.
Removed dependency on Mike Stone's user profile cleanup script.

2.8.1.8:
Truncated the Sell New User Name box maximum length to 20 characters.
Windows will throw an exception if a username exceeds this length and fail to
create an account, resulting in a machine with no accounts.
Added ROSY (OSIRiS Recovery System) to the server containing OSIRiS.
ROSY can reset a customers machine for them, should they find OSIRiS on it when
they arrive home. Full instructions for it's use will be added to the OSIRiS 
landing page at https://gnuplusadam.com/OSIRiS/ soon.

2.8.1.7:
Added a manual tool, under the "manual_tools" folder to change ODIN's clearance
banner if it is incorrectly set. This tool can also switch ODIN from scheduled mode
over to the newer reg called mode.
(This tool is the only script that should be run manually out of the resources folder)
Added a REGEX to the computer rename call so that ALL special characters are 
accounted for. Previously if the model contained spaces they where handled but if 
other special characters where present, the rename silently failed.

2.8.1.6:
Modified the way ODIN is called on login. The previous method was to use a scheduled
task, however this proved troublesome on newer machines with wonky scheduler settings.
The improved method is to write a registry entry to 
HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run in the form of "ODIN" pointing to
the ODIN executable at C:\profiles\ and optionally appending the "clear" argument to
display the clearance banner.
Began modernisation of C# code and transition over to WPF/XAML.

2.8.1.5:
Beginning of the change log/release notes for OSIRiS.
Added an update completion form with check box to allow for easy access to
release notes. The actual release notes text file is stored in the users %TEMP%
directory not on the OSIRiS USB.
