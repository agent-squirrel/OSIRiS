--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.0.0:
OSIRiS now sleeps machines at night and wakes them up at 7AM. The machines will
remain in a low power state until the morning, this was chosen to replace the
previous shutdown functionality as once a machine is off, it cannot be woken up
via software.
Updated all documentation to reflect new copyright/copyleft licensing terms and
to include and extension into 2016.
 
3.0.0.8:
Fixed scaling issues with OSIRiS Main Window.
Added an About window that houses the OSIRiS version number and manual links.

3.0.0.7:
Fixed file_integrity checklist.

3.0.0.6:
Added a forceable update parameter. Set the text file "force" on the server to
1 to force updates or 0 to cancel the force.

3.0.0.5:
Replaced user profile cleanup routine with an off-the-shelf powershell script.
The script is a product of Andrew Saraceni (saraceni@wharton.upenn.edu) and
available on Microsoft TechNet.
This is WAY more thorough and completely cleans the C:\Users directory.
ROSY is now in sync with OSIRiS sell routine as well.

3.0.0.4:
Fixed critical bug that caused shutdown tasks to not be removed on "Sell" of
display machine. Updated ROSY code to match.

3.0.0.3:
You can now check for updates manually with the key combination CTRL+SHIFT+U.
This is useful if OSIRiS is failing to update itself or in the case of a spotty
internet connection.
The formatter will now check for disk sizes in excess of 2TB when working with the
FAT32 filesystem, this is to prevent Ridgecrop consultants "fat32format" utility
from presenting an error message and making OSIRiS look like it has hung.
A dialog box has been added on press of the format button confirming the drive
name to be formatted.

3.0.0.1:
Fixed some misc comments in the code that no longer apply.
Updated ODIN to allow for automatic updates. ODIN will now check for a new version
of itself on startup every day. Updating only takes a few seconds and ODIN will
display it's splash screen while this is happening.

3.0.0.0:
Complete re-design of the OSIRiS UI. OSIRiS now conforms (loosly) to Google's
Material Design language. In addition, the console output boxes are no longer
present and a singe line of text has taken their place. This text is updated with
messages about the running of OSIRiS and better shows if OSIRiS has crashed or
is struggling.

2.8.2.0:
Fixed a bug where the updater would check for updates even if there was a currupted
OSIRiS install. If there is a corrupted install AND an update available OSIRiS
defaults to fixing the install.

2.8.1.9:
ROSY landing page is operational at https://gnuplusadam.com/OSIRiS/ROSY.
Removed dependency on Mike Stone's user profile cleanup script.

2.8.1.8:
Truncated the Sell New User Name box maximum length to 20 characters.
Windows will throw an exception if a username exceeds this length and fail to
create an account, resulting in a machine with no accounts.
Added ROSY (OSIRiS Recovery System) to the server containing OSIRiS.
ROSY can reset a customers machine for them, should they find OSIRiS on it when
they arrive home. Full instructions for it's use will be added to the OSIRiS
landing page at https://gnuplusadam.com/OSIRiS/ soon.

2.8.1.7:
Added a manual tool, under the "manual_tools" folder to change ODIN's clearance
banner if it is incorrectly set. This tool can also switch ODIN from scheduled mode
over to the newer reg called mode.
(This tool is the only script that should be run manually out of the resources folder)
Added a REGEX to the computer rename call so that ALL special characters are
accounted for. Previously if the model contained spaces they where handled but if
other special characters where present, the rename silently failed.

2.8.1.6:
Modified the way ODIN is called on login. The previous method was to use a scheduled
task, however this proved troublesome on newer machines with wonky scheduler settings.
The improved method is to write a registry entry to
HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run in the form of "ODIN" pointing to
the ODIN executable at C:\profiles\ and optionally appending the "clear" argument to
display the clearance banner.
Began modernisation of C# code and transition over to WPF/XAML.

2.8.1.5:
Beginning of the change log/release notes for OSIRiS.
Added an update completion form with check box to allow for easy access to
release notes. The actual release notes text file is stored in the users %TEMP%
directory not on the OSIRiS USB.
